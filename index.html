        Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be
        destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape
        for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are
        you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.
        What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or
        smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going? The
        Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those
        transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We
        intercepted no transmissions. Aaah., This is a consular ship. Watch your
        mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be
        safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few
        maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins! How long before
        you can make the jump to light speed? It'll take a few moments to get
        the coordinates from the navi-computer. Are you kidding? At the rate
        they're gaining. Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops,
        boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or
        bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick,
        wouldn't it? What's that flashing? We're losing our deflector shield. Go
        strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed. Chewie
        here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. Yes,
        indeed. If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the
        Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run
        in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the
        local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships
        now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? Only
        passengers. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell!
        Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going
        to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there! Oh! The garbage
        chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've
        discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there. No! wait! Will
        you forget it? I already tried it. You mean it controls your actions?
        Partially. But it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient
        weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You don't
        believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this
        galaxy to the other.
